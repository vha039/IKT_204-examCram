1. OSI layer mapping (C1 2 pts)  
   Match DHCP, TLS, ICMP, Switch‑MAC learning to the highest OSI layer involved.

2. DNS TTL field (C1 2 pts)  
   Explain how a low TTL can aid CDN load balancing.

   Provide a display filter string to show QUIC traffic only (dst port 443/udp).

5. HTTP ETag validation (C2 4 pts)  
   Sequence: client caches object with `ETag: "v2"`, later sends conditional GET.  
   a) Server reply if object unchanged.  
   b) Does reply carry message body?

6. UDP MTU issue (C2 4 pts)  
   Packet length = 2 000 B, path MTU = 1 500 B, DF = 0. Describe fragmentation.

7. CIDR host count (C2 4 pts)  
   How many hosts fit into a /22? Show formula.

8. TLS record fields (C2 4 pts)  
   Name two differences between TLS 1.3 and 1.2 record layer.

9. CRC syndrome meaning (C3 6 pts)  
   Dataword 110101, divisor 1011: compute remainder and syndrome; interpret.

10. OSPF cost puzzle (C4 8 pts)  
    Path A: 100 Mb/s + 10 Gb/s; Path B: 10 Gb/s + 10 Gb/s. Using ref 100 Mb/s cost rule, which path is chosen? Explain step‑by‑step.

*Subtotal Part A = 40 pts*

Part B – Extended / Scenario (60 pts)
────────────────────────────────────
11. TCP ACK delay impact (C3 6 pts)  
    Link RTT = 40 ms. Receiver uses delayed ACK (200 ms). Compute throughput loss compared with immediate ACK for cwnd = 4 MSS.

12. DNS negative caching (C3 6 pts)  
    Describe SOA MINIMUM and how NXDOMAIN caching reduces root load.

13. TCP vs BBR cwnd graph (C4 8 pts)  
    Given plotted cwnd vs time for both algorithms over same path, explain why BBR maintains higher goodput at 1% loss.

14. HTTP/3 datagram (C2 4 pts)  
    Role of DATAGRAM frame vs STREAM in unreliable media.

15. CIDR super‑aggregate (C3 6 pts)  
    Combine /25, /26, /27 contiguous blocks starting at 198.18.0.0 into minimum prefixes.

16. NAT logging compliance (C3 6 pts)

    Explain how ACK range blocks compress gaps vs TCP SACK.

*Total = 100 pts (C1 8 % , C2 36 % , C3 32 % , C4 24 %)*
